const heading =document.createElemenet("h1") -> creates an h1 element.

heading.innerHTML = "Hello world from Javascript".
const root = document.getElementById('root').
root.appendChild(heading). -> will put heading inside div


Ways to inject react into our project : 

1. CDN - Content Delivery Network( do research on this : what and why we use this). 
2. So there are two links regarding this. First one is this : https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js. UMD - Universal Module Definition which allows the a javascript module to be used in various environment. The above link comprises of 
just basic development code.

3. 2nd is : https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js : Bridges the DOM and React core code.

4. What is cross origing in the cdn links - homework.

5. Why eveyrthing i.e. script inside body tag?

6. What is root in react - So root is a DOM entry point for a React code. It is through the root element, react is 
able to render our application. 

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))
root.render(heading)

7. How to create an element in React : React.createElement('h1',{object which contains attributes}, 'Hello
World from React').

8. What is heading ? It is a javascript object( not an html tag h1 as defined above) which has the following properties : 
type = h1. 
props : {id : heading} 
children : 'Hello world from React'

9. root.render - it converts the javascript object into an html tag and appends the tag inside of root.
